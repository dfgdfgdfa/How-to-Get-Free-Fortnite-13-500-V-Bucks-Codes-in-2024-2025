Avoiding Scams
With the demand for V-Bucks, scams are rampant. Be cautious of websites or services that promise free codes in exchange for personal information or payment. Always verify the legitimacy of a source before engaging with it.

Common Scams to Avoid
Phishing Websites: Always ensure youâ€™re on the official Fortnite website or trusted platforms.
Offers Asking for Personal Information: Never provide sensitive information to claim V-Bucks.
